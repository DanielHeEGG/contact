# Contact `DanielHeEGG`
Ways to (securely) communicate with me in case of extreme circumstances, such as widespread government censorship.

### Emails
> If you are also using Proton Mail, emails sent to `me@daniel-egg.com` should already be encrypted. In other cases, your message should be encrypted with my PGP key for secure communication. You should also include your PGP key in the message for encrypted replies.
- `me@daniel-egg.com` (via Proton Mail)
- `danielheegg@gmail.com` (via Google)

### PGP Key
> Ideally, the signature of this key should be checked with me in person while you can confirm my identity. In cases where that is not possible, the next best option is to confirm that all three links below produce the same key. All three links should be what you would expect, and this commit should be signed and verified.
